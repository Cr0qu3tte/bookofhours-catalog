## Do this

- Wisdom Tree!
- Show paginated notes for situations
- Unlock for various terrains have icons. Add iconUrl to terrain and show it in unlock menu.
  - Use this icon in Locations page.
- Pinning for items in search dialog.
- Recipe selector for freeform situation orchestrations. See the ambit properties.
- Allow master book recipe execution to be ok with not-quite-as-many-aspects recipe.
- use situation.thresholdContents in SituationModel.thresholdContents$
- Clean up awaitIdle hack with SituationModel
- Show ElementStackIcon instead of ElementIcon for skills in crafting page, so tooltip is correct regarding aspects.

- Orchestration autofill: Pick highest card that works without going over.

## Maybe

- Turn unlock dialog into another orchestration type.
- Prompt / toast the user for empty slots or new notes in recipes after time skip.
- Flip over element stacks. Before using them? Automatically on finding them?

  - Recipe executor can make use of flipped over cards, confusing the game

- Autofill orchestration for reading books doesnt pull in the language
