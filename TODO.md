## Do this

- Wisdom Tree!
- Show paginated notes for situations
- Unlock for various terrains have icons. Add iconUrl to terrain and show it in unlock menu.
  - Use this icon in Locations page.
- Pinning for items in search dialog.
- Recipe selector for freeform situation orchestrations. See the ambit properties.
- Allow master book recipe execution to be ok with not-quite-as-many-aspects recipe.
- use situation.thresholdContents in SituationModel.thresholdContents$
- Re-enable multithreaded reading. Currently off as situation.canExecute uses caches that can collide

## Maybe

- Prompt / toast the user for empty slots or new notes in recipes after time skip.
- Flip over element stacks. Before using them? Automatically on finding them?
  - Recipe executor can make use of flipped over cards, confusing the game
